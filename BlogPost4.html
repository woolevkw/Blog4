  <p>The last app I made was a React App. I used Angular for this final project instead of React again to both challenge myself by learning something new and also
     broadening my overall back end development skillset. This application is called 'Hall of Heroes'. It is a basic Angular app that has its own tutorial on the
     official Angular website. The app starts off by showing the user the most popular heroes. There is a search bar where the user can type to look up a specific
     hero. They can also click on one of the heroes to look at their stats. A sashboard button is always available so the user can return to the main screen. There
     is also a Heroes button that displays all of the heros available. The user can then add to the list or delete heroes if they so choose. In addition, there is
     a text field below everything that reports to the user what has happened. The text box can be cleared at any given time with another button called 'Clear Messages'.
     The hardest part for me personally just like last time was deploying the app. I really wanted to get this app on my website, but after hours and hours of searching
     the web and watching videos on how to do it, I still could not figure it out. However, I did find another way to deploy it which I will get back to later.</p>

  <h4>I will do my best to explain how I did this, but if you want a real tutorial, click the link I provided above.</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>First things first, I decided I wanted to crate the app locally using my Windows Command Prompt.
      <ul>
          <li>I simply created a new Angular app 'ng new angular-tour-of-heroes'.</li>
          <li>I then opened the app in a browser (localhost: 4200).</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Next, I created a Heroes component by entering the command 'ng generate component heroes'.
      <ul>
          <li>This component is where we will store some hero information such as their names.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>I started modifying and adding to the code by setting up the component so it can be used for an unlimited number of heroes. It's like a template.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>There are going to be many more templates to make below.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Now that we can have a hero component, the next step is to create a list to display all of the available heroes.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Since there are going to be multiple heroes, it would be nice to display them all on the screen using lists.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Using these lists, we will now be able to select the different heroes and see their different stats/traits.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>I used *ngFor to display the lise of heroes. I also toggled a CSS style class with a class binding.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>After that, the next thing I did was create a Feature Component.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Similarly to the last component I created, this one will show all of the necessary details for each hero.</li>
          <li>'ng generate component hero-detail'</li>
      </ul>
      <li>This component will contain a template that can be modified according to whatever trait a hero needs.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Additionally, this new component is a child of the first Hero component I made earlier. I did this with property binding.</li>
          <li>I also used the @Input decorator to make the hero property available for binding by the external Hero Component.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Guess what time it is? Another component time!</li>
      <ul>
          <li>I created another componet called Service.</li>
          <li>The app can run right now, but the information it displays is fake/old data. The service component will be able to get real time data and inject it into the other components.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>I do this by registering a provider. This provider is something that can create or deliver a service.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>When a service is provided at the root level, Angular crates a single instance that's shared of HeroService and it inject it into any class that asks for it.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>I then created two more components called 'MessageComponent' and 'MessageService'.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>With these components we are now able to communicate back and forth to share information about the Heroes.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>We are almost there, just a few things left!</li>
      <li>We need to be able to navigate around the app and flip between pages to see different information about the Heroes.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>I did this with Navigation Routing.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>This will give us seperate dashboard and Hero pages to organize and sort information.</li>
      <li>I used HTTPClient methods to do most of this.</li>
      <li>Now that we have basic navigation, the last thing I attempted to inplement is gathering data from a server.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>The HeroService will get its data with HTTP requests.</li>
          <li>With that, the users will be able to search for, add, edit, and delete heroes and save their changes via HTTP.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>I used HTTPClient methods to do most of this.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>I also created smaller methods so the user will be able to do the simple actions listed above. (add, edit, delete)</li>
          <li>I put the search bar on the main dashboard page to make life easier for the user to find specific heroes.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Now that the app is complete, I had to deploy it on my website. Again this part was very challenging for me because I couldn't find anything online on how to do it.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Thankfully, my prof was able to point me in the right direction.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>I was able to build the application without any compile errors which was really good. My main issue was putting all the files from my computer onto my server.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>I had some files in the wrong locations in my directories so after a little bit of organizing, I was able to deploy the app on my personal website.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And that is it Ladies and Gentleman! This Angular app was a little more difficult to make than my last one, but I still think anyone who has basic web knowledge can do this.</p>
